              I am Melissa Kuseliauskas, the founder of Art Intervention
              Dynamics, LLC. I have dedicated years developing this program. I
              have conducted research and implemented this curriculum for two
              and a half years with outstanding results and am currently
              conducting more research and publishing an article on my findings.
              I also have experience in the education system as a teacher and
              researcher. I am very passionate about this program. I love seeing
              individuals with special needs finally being able to communicate
              and be their own person after years of frustration. I have seen
              first hand people become much happier individuals. I will put
              everything I have into tailoring my curriculums to every schools
              needs and make sure that they have every tool needed to succeed.
